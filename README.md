# pysweeper
Repository for minesweeper made in Python

This game is a recreation of the classical windows game "Minesweeper" in the hopes if bringing it back to life.

It also contains modes of gameplay and various settings to modify (difficulty, board size, etc.).

I started coding this out of fun 2 years ago and quickly dropped it after getting the first buttons set up in the GUI.

If you'd like to try it out and/or want new modes just create a pull request.


I'll be working on this project to maybe one day bring exotic features like multiplayer.
